This is the arduino code used in the music visualizer seen here: https://youtu.be/wbuEC2a1KTU

The main functionality is provided through the SparkFun Sound Spectrum Analyzer Shield: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13116

This code is not intended to be compiled as-is (it is specifically catered to my project), but rather to serve as a reference for how something similar could be accomplished.

Reach out to me at bartlettmic@gmail.com if you have a question related to this project, I'd be happy to help you if I can!
